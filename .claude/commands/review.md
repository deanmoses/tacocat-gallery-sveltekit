# Command: Code Review

Perform comprehensive code review against plan requirements and project standards.

## Review Process

1. **Load Context**: Review the relevant plan and project standards
2. **Analyze Changes**: Examine all modified files and their purpose
3. **Verify Requirements**: Ensure all plan objectives are met
4. **Check Quality**: Validate against project standards
5. **Test Verification**: Confirm all tests pass and coverage is adequate
