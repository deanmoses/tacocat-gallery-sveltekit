- [ ] Automated bundle size regression detection

## Implementation Steps

### TypeScript Enhancement (High Priority)

1. [ ] **Audit Type Assertions**: Review all `@ts-expect-error` and `as` assertions

    - Acceptance criteria: Replace with proper type guards or interface improvements
    - Testing approach: TypeScript strict mode verification

2. [ ] **Strengthen Test Types**: Add proper typing to test utilities

    - Acceptance criteria: All test helpers fully typed, no `any` types
    - Testing approach: Type check test files separately

3. [ ] **Add Missing Type Definitions**: Fill gaps in interface coverage
    - Acceptance criteria: All component props and state properly typed
    - Testing approach: Component prop validation tests

### Testing Enhancement (High Priority)

1. [ ] **State Machine Integration Tests**: Add comprehensive integration testing

    - Acceptance criteria: All state transitions tested with realistic scenarios
    - Testing approach: End-to-end state machine workflow tests

2. [ ] **Cross-Component Interaction Tests**: Test component communication patterns

    - Acceptance criteria: Admin/guest mode switching, state propagation tested
    - Testing approach: Component integration tests with real state

3. [ ] **Error Boundary Testing**: Add error handling verification
    - Acceptance criteria: Graceful error handling in all critical paths
    - Testing approach: Error injection and recovery testing

### Documentation Enhancement (Medium Priority)

1. [ ] **Component JSDoc Standardization**: Add comprehensive component documentation

    - Acceptance criteria: All components have `@component`, `@example`, props documented
    - Testing approach: Documentation coverage verification

2. [ ] **Architecture Decision Records**: Document key architectural choices

    - Acceptance criteria: State machine pattern, caching strategy, lazy loading documented
    - Testing approach: Architecture review with stakeholders

3. [ ] **Performance Documentation**: Document performance patterns and benchmarks
    - Acceptance criteria: Bundle size guidelines, lazy loading patterns documented
    - Testing approach: Performance benchmark validation

### Complexity Reduction (Medium Priority)

1. [ ] **Upload State Machine Refactoring**: Simplify complex async coordination

    - Acceptance criteria: Break into smaller, focused state machines
    - Testing approach: Maintain 100% functionality while reducing complexity

2. [ ] **Component Hierarchy Flattening**: Reduce deeply nested component structures

    - Acceptance criteria: Improve component discoverability and maintainability
    - Testing approach: Component import path optimization

3. [ ] **Utility Function Extraction**: Extract reusable patterns from components
    - Acceptance criteria: Reduce code duplication, improve reusability
    - Testing approach: Unit tests for extracted utilities

### Performance Monitoring (Low Priority)

1. [ ] **Bundle Size Regression Testing**: Automated bundle size monitoring

    - Acceptance criteria: Bundle size changes trigger alerts
    - Testing approach: CI/CD integration with size thresholds

2. [ ] **Performance Benchmark Suite**: Automated performance regression detection

    - Acceptance criteria: Page load, interaction metrics tracked
    - Testing approach: Lighthouse CI integration

3. [ ] **Memory Leak Detection**: Monitor for memory leaks in long-running sessions
    - Acceptance criteria: No memory growth over extended usage
    - Testing approach: Automated memory profiling

## Technical Implementation Details

### TypeScript Enhancements

```typescript
// Current pattern with type assertion
const data = response.data as AlbumData;

// Improved pattern with type guard
function isAlbumData(data: unknown): data is AlbumData {
    return typeof data === 'object' && data !== null && 'path' in data;
}

const data = response.data;
if (!isAlbumData(data)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid album data received');
}
```

### Component Documentation Standard

```typescript
/**
 * @component AlbumThumbnail
 * @description Displays a clickable thumbnail for an album with lazy loading
 */
interface AlbumThumbnailProps {
    /** Album data to display */
    album: Album;
    /** Thumbnail size variant */
    size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Enhanced State Machine Testing

- **Integration scenarios**: Full workflows from initial state to completion
- **Error path testing**: Network failures, validation errors, timeout handling
- **Concurrent operation testing**: Multiple uploads, navigation during upload

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes

- [ ] JSDoc documentation additions
- [ ] Test coverage expansion
- [ ] Type guard implementations

### Medium Risk Changes

- [ ] State machine refactoring (needs careful testing)
- [ ] Component hierarchy changes (may affect imports)

### Dependencies

- [ ] No external dependencies required
- [ ] All improvements work with existing architecture
- [ ] Incremental implementation possible

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All TypeScript type assertions eliminated
- [ ] Test coverage >95% on state machines
- [ ] All components have comprehensive JSDoc
- [ ] Upload state machine complexity reduced significantly
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated with architectural decisions
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Bundle size impact measured and acceptable

## Notes

This project already demonstrates exceptional quality and modern best practices. These improvements are refinements to an already excellent foundation rather than fundamental architectural changes. The codebase serves as an exemplar of modern SvelteKit development patterns.

### Key Architectural Strengths to Preserve

- State machine pattern for complex operations
- Three-tier caching strategy (memory â†’ IDB â†’ server)
- Lazy loading of admin functionality
- Snippet-based component composition
- Comprehensive TypeScript integration
